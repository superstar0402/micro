# Trust Scale, the NFTfi Credit Score

Trust Scale is a protocol for determining a wallet's creditworthiness for acting as a borrower in
NFT loans. This worthiness is expressed in a numerical value, the NFTfi credit score.

# Overview

## Problem

Currently, creditworthiness in the NFT loans market is opaque. Users and protocols alike have very
little visibility over a borrower's credit history, which makes it difficult to ascertain their
likelihood of default. This opaqueness make it difficult to negotiate terms in a transparent way,
since lenders don't know much about the borrower's profile. We aim to change that, by giving
borrowers to possibility to show lenders their onchain NFTfi credit score.

## Solution

Trust Scale gives a wallet a numerical credit score, which enables its owner to leverage their
credit history to better negotiate NFT loan terms. This score is given in the form of a
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) that the wallet owner can create, for lenders to later verify. The use of
ZKPs enable users to keep their scores private from the general public, so they may preserve their
privacy.

## Calculation method

We take into account a wallet's past history when interacting with NFTfi protocols to determine its
creditworthiness. The calculation is done via a weighted average of two variables - the borrower's
Historical Performance Score (HPS) and their Trustworthiness Score (TS). The HPS is a composite
score, which expresses the wallet's past behaviour as a borrower. It takes into account the user's
default-to-loan ratio, loan recency, loan size and credit utilization. As for TS, it expresses the
wallet's past behaviour as a lender, which gives further depth and context about their borrower
profile. It does so by considering past loan offers, effective loans and asset diversity in what is
also a composite score.

## How It Works

- Borrower visits our website, where they connect their wallet and emit a ZKP of their credit score.
- Borrower can submit their real-life credit score, to be taken into account in score computation.
  This information is kept private via IExec's Data Protector.
- Lenders visit our website to verify the borrower's ZKP, thus confirming their claim to better loan
  terms.

## Future Protocol Expansion

This protocol has a lot of potential for modularity and expansion, namely in terms of accessibility
and functionality. In terms of accessibility, the borrower could mint an NFT with their score, as
well as create a widget / API that enables protocols to easily display someone's credit score to
other users, should they wish to. In terms of functionality, there's a lot of potential to expand
the protocol to take into account the borrower's DeFi credit score. This will strengthen their case
for negotiating better loan terms and make the transaction as transparent and data-backed as
possible, while still preserving the borrower's privacy.

# Notes on external component usage

## iExec

[iExec](https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/) is a protocol for decentralized cloud computing.

Our project's original plan was to utilize iExec for securing a separate credit score for each user.
This credit score would originate from the user's bank or similar entity. This score would then be
used securely through iExec encrypted data when calculating the final score used in this project.
The user could request the score by email, by utilizing iExec's privatized email sending.

Unfortunately, we never got the email component working properly and our email tasks
[never completed](https://explorer.iex.ec/bellecour/address/0x615bcaca28523ba081071e68e818b44948c1dd5a).
Due to time constraints, we decided not to include this in the final product. The code used is
stored in a
[separate branch](https://github.com/microbecode/ethlisbon/blob/iexec/components/component.js#L128).

## Neon EVM

[Neon EVM](https://neonevm.org/) is a revolutionary project to combine the data of Solana with EVM
compatibility.

Since Solana's NFT ecosystem is huge, the opportunity to incorporate Solana's NFT lending data
couldn't be ignored. We got our project [deployed on Neon EVM](#neon-evm-1), but unfortunately did
not have the time to incorporate the real NFT lending data.

# Technical details

## System architecture

## Privacy

The program uses Zero Knowledge technology to hide the credit score. NFT lenders can query our
service for whether a certain address has a credit score above certain number or not - they can't
find out the exact score.

The ZK language used is Noir from Aztec. The project includes a Noir circuit, an autogenerated
Solidity verifier and interaction through the website.

## Environments

This Noir verifier contract is accessible in the Polygon ZkEVM testnet, at address
0xe9D7E3FCa12fEcC54167Fb9DD2EE7c52ca404fB8 . For faster testing, local Hardhat deployment is
recommended.

## Installation

1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (tested on yarn v1.22.19)

2. Install [Node.js ≥v18](https://nodejs.org/en) (tested on v18.17.0)

3. Install [noirup](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo_installation/#option-1-noirup) with

   ```bash
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/main/install | bash
   ```

4. Install Nargo v0.17.0 with

   ```bash
   noirup -v 0.17.0
   ```

If you had a lower version of `nargo` installed previously and are running into errors when
compiling, you may need to uninstall it, instructions
[here](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo_installation#uninstalling-nargo).

5. Install dependencies with

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

## Test locally

1. Copy `next-hardhat/.env.example` to a new file `next-hardhat/.env`.

2. Start a local development EVM at <http://localhost:8545> with

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

3. Run the unit tests with

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Deploy locally

1. Copy `next-hardhat/.env.example` to a new file `next-hardhat/.env`.

2. Start a local development EVM at <http://localhost:8545> with

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

3. Build the project and deploy contracts to the local development chain with

   ```bash
   NETWORK=localhost npm run dev
   ```

4. Once your contracts are deployed and the build is finished, start the web app with

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Deploy on real networks
